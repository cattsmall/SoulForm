SoulForm
========

Make a song in 4 minutes! This game is an experiment intended to reproduce the feeling I get when I dance to music.

For the best experience, plug in a dance mat and hook up the arrows to WASD. Try playing with more than one person for a real good time!

**Controls:**

- WASD/dance mat arrows for various types of bass
- Leap Motion to play notes
